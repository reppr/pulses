README_periodics

  This is the old ~/ARDUINO-GIT2/periodics/ git repo,
  cloned,
  prepared for merge,
  and then merged into my main pulses repo.

  'periodics' is the direct paren for pulses.
  It was based on 'polyphonic_oscillators'.

  Please remember to check the following later on:

  THERE HAVE BEEN UNCOMMITED CHANGES IN ~/ARDUINO-GIT2/periodics/
  AND OTHER BRANCHES.

  I should   CHECK THESE FOR VALUABLE CODE FRAGMENTS WHEN DONE.
