Pulses

  Arduino library to raise actions in harmonical time intervalls.

  Erroneously built from ~/ARDUINO-GIT2/polyphonic_oscillators/
  instead of ~/ARDUINO-GIT2/periodics/

  ==> >> >>> DO NOT USE <<< << <==


  After working a while on this early version I realize I have
  taken a wrong git repo as source!

  As there where too many changes and renames I think it is
  better to throw that away and restart it all again from
  scratch.

  As a part of the code might prove to be recyclable I keep it
  pulses/misc/src/Pulses_0/ for a while.
