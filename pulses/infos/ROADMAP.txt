 Roadmap for "Living Room Festival 2019"
*****************************************

August 24-31, HARDTURMBRACHE, ZÃ¼rich Switzerland

some first ideas about planing the roadmap:


****************************************************************
keep all the HARDWARE up to date
  LillyBoy	(ok) 12V led string on ~10V	mechanical construction		battery compartment
  CHATEAU	(ok) 5V led string on USB	fix led string on instrument	better morse input
  FitNess	morse, maybe bluetooth broken	no led string yet	test MPU6050
  butler	 ?
  chameleon	 ?
  placeholderTM0 ?
  etc...	 others under construction


CALIBRATE *all* MPU6050

****************************************************************
solo and ENSEMBLE real live everyday testing
  including guests playing&dancing with active Y_UI

let people PLAY&DANCE with motion detecting instruments
  get feedback
  observe movement patterns
  configure and connect Y_UI accordingly...



****************************************************************
NVS
  nvs_menu	configure all the instruments in the band
  HARDWARE	*one* program for all
		individual configuration based on NVS configuration


new IMPLEMENTATION for MOTION UI	Y_UI
  updated configuration type


SECURITY  (maybe some attempts only present in my private sources)
  secure morse inputs, calibrate before start
  ESP NOW security


ESP NOW NET
  ACK on important configuration messages
  message numbering
  OLED info and Y_UI


new INSTRUMENTS
  SexOpus	6 armed light strings
  SubBass	to sit on it	maybe
  magicBall	play&dance with it,	includes Y_UI,	maybe some LEDs,	*no sound*, *no display*

RGB LED
  slowly FADING when the cycle is over
  float intensity

  test GAMMA CORRECTION

  hue_slice_cnt diatonic/pentatonic
    *tuning* should set the note count (like 5 or 7)
    (or store it in SCALES)
      then set accoringly, i.e. in units of 3 (3 basic colours)
	pentatonic: 15	hepta: 21
	or double   20	       42 ;)	but that's a lot...
	*TEST that first*			OK TESTED NOW, looks promising :)	now implement
      what to do with 2, 3, 4?

  background colour memory



maybe:
*******

AEOLUS	would be very nice :)	if there is time...
	much work: MIDI
		   raspberry 4, power, configuration, automatic startup
		   aeolus
		   tuning...



****************************************************************
probably AFTER the festival
****************************************************************


add SENSORS reacting on ENVIRONMENT (not only on instrument movement)
  distance sensors
  light change
  high impedance static voltage detector
  touch value reading (reacting on short range only)

generic DC INPUT

VOLTAGE CONTROLLED UNIVERSAL AUDIO FILTER
  connect to:
    distance sensors
    MPU6050
    generic DC INPUT

MOVEMENT DETECTOR
  has an eye on acc/gyro activities in the background
  can switch Y_UI accordingly

PLL 4046
SOFTWARE PLL?

add MICRO for sound input
  tuning
  sampling
  PLL 4046
  feedback
  guess played scale, tune and try to play along... ;)
