low brightness problem:

#define SDA_OLED     4
#define SCL_OLED     15
Wire.begin(SDA_OLED, SCL_OLED)

4, 15

see: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/problem-with-esp32-heltec-v2-display/134501/6

The I2C hardware interface consists of 2 lines: SDA and SCL.
In Arduino board definitions the names 'SDA' and 'SCL' normally
map to the corresponding GPIO pins of the I2C interface.
However, for the Heltec Wifi LoRa 32 V2 board 'SDA' and 'SCL'
are incorrectly defined!: SDA is defined as 21 and SCL as 22.
But on the Heltec Wifi LoRa 32 V2 board GPIO21 is used for switching 
VExt output instead and is not used for SDA.
The V2 board uses GPIO4 for SDA and GPIO15 for SCL instead.

When using the Wire (I2C) interface in Arduino, it by default will use 
pin definitions 'SDA' and 'SCL' which for Wifi LoRa 32 V2 are 
incorrect! *Any any sketch and any library* that initializes the 
Wire interface by calling Wire.begin() without parameters
(which is common) will use the wrong pins for SDA and SCL!

As workaround you must explicitly call Wire.begin(SDA_OLED, SCL_OLED)
AT THE START of setup() BEFORE initializing any libraries.
This will configure the wire interface to use
the correct GPIO pins for SDA (4) and SCL (15).
If you omit this then the I2C (Wire) interface and its connected
peripherals will not work and strange things may happen to VExt.
