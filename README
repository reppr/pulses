pulses
an arduino project.


I have started working on the very basics,
will try to explain later...


Already working:

* The Menu library.

  A Menu can be used to interact with your Arduino sketch over a stream interface
  like Serial. So you could send commands (mostly one letter tokens) and numbers
  from your computer over USBserial and let it trigger sketch functions, set
  variables, get informations back over USBserial and the like.

  As exact timing will be crucial to the pulses project the Menu class is
  implemented in a way that it will never block program flow any longer then
  necessary. I call this 'run-through-technique'. The menu returns immediately
  if it has nothing to do, on input collecting a single byte of input a time
  until it receives an 'end token'.

  The menu will never delay unless *you* program an action that does that,
  and tell the menu to trigger it ;)

  Menu has support for multiple menu pages and 'visability groups' that make
  pages be active for a group of pages, even if only one of them is visible.

  More documentation planed after using and developping it for a while.
  Ask if you need it now...

  Please see the examples for how to do use it.
  The source is also full of comments meant to be useful, please read.
