README_cpp-page

   http://github.com/reppr/pulses


   This is just a very simple menupage giving informations about
   Arduino software and board. Mainly just showing some macro values.
   Much overkill for the simple task, I know ;)

   Just for a quick test (aiming at the Arduino DUE, btw).

   Not finished at all,
   barely usable but starts working.


Description

   Show some compiler and system specific infos on a menu page.


Installation:

   Get it from http://github.com/reppr/pulses
   Put contents of the pulses/libraries/ folder into sketchbook/libraries/
   Restart the Arduino GUI
   cpp-page is a page for pulses/libraries/Menu/examples/pages/
   Please see instructions there.


How it works:

   You communicate with the arduino over a stream interface
   that could be connected to something like a serial line,
   serial over USB or whatever.


Configure your terminal program:

   Do configure your terminal emulation program to send some sort of
   line ending code, usual culprits should work.

   Set arduino baud rate by editing the line starting with
   #define BAUDRATE in pages.ino
   and set it to the same value in your terminal software.

   So if for example you use the Arduino 'Serial Monitor' window
   check that it *does* send 'Newline' (in the bottom window frame)
   and set baud rate to the same value as BAUDRATE on the arduino.


   Send '?' (and a linefeed) over serial line to see the menu.
   It displays some basic infos and shows some one-letter commands.
