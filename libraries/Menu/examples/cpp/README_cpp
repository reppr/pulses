README cpp_info

   cpp_info  http://github.com/reppr/pulses


   cpp_info, arduino_info temporally implemented under libraries/Menu/examples/cpp.

   This is just a very simple menupage giving informations about
   Arduino software and board. Mainly just showing some macro values.
   Much overkill for the simple task, I know ;)

   It is not really worth an entry under libraries/Menu/examples/,
   planed to move as a menupage under libraries/Menu/examples/menupages/ soon.

   Just for a quick test (aiming at the Arduino DUE, btw).

   Not finished at all,
   barely usable but starts working.


Description

   Show some compiler and system specific infos on a menu page.

   This version is implemented as an example for the Menu library.



Installation:

   Get it from http://github.com/reppr/pulses
   Put contents of the pulses/libraries/ folder into sketchbook/libraries/
   Cpp_Info is implemented as an example of libraries/Menu/
   After a restart the Arduino GUI shows cpp_info under
   File >> Sketchbook >> libraries >> Menu >> cpp_info

	Arduino versions older than 1.0 need a fix:
	  see this thread:
	  http://code.google.com/p/arduino/issues/detail?id=604&start=200

	    short version (adapt to your arduino version)
	      edit file arduino-0022/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino/wiring.h
	      comment out line 79 (round macro)
	      #define round(x)     ((x)>=0?(long)((x)+0.5):(long)((x)-0.5))
	      tested on arduino-0023

	For older arduino versions you also have to rename the sketch file
	from cpp_info.ino to cpp_info.pde


How it works:

   You communicate with the arduino over a serial connection
   that could be a real serial line or an usb cable.


Configure your terminal program:

   Do configure your terminal emulation program to send some sort of
   line ending code, usual culprits should work.

   Set arduino baud rate by editing the line starting with
   #define BAUDRATE in cpp.ino
   and set it to the same value in your terminal software.

   So if for example you use the Arduino 'Serial Monitor' window
   check that it *does* send 'Newline' (in the bottom window frame)
   and set baud rate to the same value as BAUDRATE on the arduino.


   Send '?' (and a linefeed) over serial line to see the menu.
   It displays some basic infos and shows some one-letter commands.
