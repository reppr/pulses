  Software library collection to raise actions in harmonical time intervals.
  Periodically do multiple independent tasks named 'pulses'.

  Pulses is a harmonical experiment
    exploring analogies in topics like music, mathematics, aesthetics,
    just to name a few

  pulses runs on ESP32 and ESP8266 (i.e. NodeMCU) boards
  compiled using Arduino IDE

  FIXME: TODO: ARDUINO (Mega, Due) boards are not quite supported any more

This is a very short description of what I mean when I say 'harmonicality'
I use the terms 'harmonical' or 'harmonicality' in a broader sense,
not restricted to the musical scope.

I am talking about the implications of selected simple integer relationships
in mathematics and aesthetics, music, physics, numerics, mythology, art.

I'm not aware of any English term for that, German 'Harmonik' comes close,
	see i.e.  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kayser#Harmonik



In music a chord uses certain exactly tuned tones fitting aesthetically.
If we look at the frequencies we see *simple* rational number relationships,
frequeny relationships like 4:5:6 or 2:3:4:5

So what?
Can we hear numbers?

How is our aesthetic perception connected with mathematics, with numerics?



If I say 'harmonical experiment' I mean things like the following:

Thinking about musical chords we have tones vibrating in mathematical order.
While one makes 2 waves another makes 3, exactly.
If not, we hear that. They get out of tune.

If we take faster vibrations, keeping the exact relationship between them,
the chord gets higher.

Slowing it down it will produce bass notes, deeper and deeper
until we can hear the individual clicks rumble
somewhere between bass and rhythm.

With even slower vibrations we get rhythms.
hmm?

interesting...


Let's take the numerical relationship from something like a musical scale or chord
and tune some strings to the scale.

Now we can take a very low octave of the note as the individual metrum of this note
and repeat each note in it's own speed.
 (Pulses can drive piezzos, magnets, surface vibration speakers or something similar
  to play the notes)

Lower notes will repeat slower and higher notes faster
so an octave higher will repeat twice as fast,
all exactly tuned to the numeric time relationships of the scale.

This will play fascinating rhythmic melody patterns depending the scale,
chord progressions,
fractal-like structures.


What rhythm, what melody patterns match a minor chord?
a pentatonic scale? a tetrachord? a chord progression?

Or the other way round: How do numbers sound together?
Let the dance of numbers surprise you.


That's the kind of experiments pulses gives an instrument to try and play with.

Pulses let's the time dance and sing...
I hope some will have fun with it
