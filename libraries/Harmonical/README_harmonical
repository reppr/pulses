  Arduino library collection to raise actions in harmonical time intervals.
  Periodically do multiple independent tasks named 'pulses'.

Pulses is a harmonical experiment
running on ESP8266 NodeMCU and ARDUINO (Mega, Due) boards.

It explores analogies in topics like music, mathematics, aesthetics,
just to name a few.


I use the terms 'harmonical' or 'harmonicality' in a broader sense,
not restricted to the musical scope.

I am talking about the implications of selected simple integer relationships
in mathematics and aesthetics, music, physics, numerics, mythology, art.

I'm not aware of any English term for that, German 'Harmonik' comes close,
	see i.e.  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kayser#Harmonik



In music a chord uses certain selected tones fitting aesthetically.
If we look at the frequencies we see *simple* rational number relationships,
frequeny relationships like 4:5:6 or 2:3:4:5

So what?
Can we hear numbers?

How is our aesthetic perception connected with mathematics, with numerics?



If I say 'harmonical experiment' I mean things like the following:

Thinking about musical chords we have tones vibrating in mathematical order.
While one makes 2 waves another makes 3, exactly.
If not, we hear that. They get out of tune.

If we take faster vibrations, keeping the exact relationship between them,
the chord gets higher.

Slowing it down it will produce bass notes, deeper and deeper
until we can hear the individual clicks rumble
somewhere between bass and rhythm.

With slow vibrations we get rhythms.
hmm?

interesting


Tuning the drums of the rhythm to a short note in the original pitch
while the drum keeps beating slow,  in a very low octave of the same note
we get fascinating melody patterns, chord progressions,
fractal-like structures.


What rhythm, what melody patterns match a minor chord?
a pentatonic scale? a chord progression?

Or the other way round: How do the numbers sound together?


That's the kind of questions pulses gives an instrument to try and play with.

I hope some will have fun with it :)
