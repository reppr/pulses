  Arduino library collection to raise actions in harmonical time intervals.
  Periodically do multiple independent tasks named 'pulses'.

  some pulses can contol hardware pins
  i call them 'click' pulses
  if you hang piezzos on them you'll hear them click, or making sounds

  Pulses can do many other things
  like starting other pulses
  playing patterns
  sweeping
  give infos.

  and yes, they can also blink a LED :)
  many LEDs in synchronised patterns, btw

  during that other program functions continue to run,
  *if* there are the ressources
